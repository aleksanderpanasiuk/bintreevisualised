# Binary Tree Visualised

Visual Studo Code extension made to visualise binary trees while debugging.

## Usage

Before trying out the extension you must verify that correct variable names are set (check extension settings). After staring a debug session in Visual Studo Code run "Build Tree" command. A new window should start with tree built from current root down. The tree should automatically update as the current root changes.

## Extension Settings

* `bintreevisualised.valueName`: Tree node value variable name.
* `bintreevisualised.leftName`: Tree node left child variable name.
* `bintreevisualised.rightName`: Tree node right child variable name.

## Language support
This extension should work with every language as long as node values are compatible with javascript number type.
